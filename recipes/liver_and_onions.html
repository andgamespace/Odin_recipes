            <strong>Step 1: </strong>
            <p> 
                Heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a skillet over moderate heat,
                mixing it in the oil until it's soft. Move it to a blender, puree the spinach
                until it becomes a coarse paste.

                Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat, cook cumin 
                in hot oil until there is an aroma. Add onion, green chile peppers, and garlic. Cook 
                and stir until onion is tender, 3-4 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cover 
                saucepan. Simmer for a minute, adding blended spinach paste, water,
                ground coriander, red chile powder, and salt. Cook until heated through,
                should take around 2.5 minutes.
