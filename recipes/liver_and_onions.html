        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <li>2 pounds of beef liver</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>2 large vidalia onions, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Step 1: </strong>
            <p> 
                Rinse liver slices under cold water, place it into a medium bowl.
                Pour in enough enough milk to cover it. Let it stand while doing the 
                preparation work for onion. This step helps to remove the bitter 
                taste of the liver.

            <strong>Step 2: </strong>
            <p>
                Place 2 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Separate onion rings,
                and saute them in butter until soft. Remove the onion, and let the remaining
                butter melt in the skillet. Season the flour with salt and pepper, place it in a shallow dish
                or on a plate. Drain milk from liver, and cover slices in the flour mixture. 
            </p>
            <strong>Step 3: </strong>
            <p> 
                After the butter has melted, change the heat to between
                medium and high. Put the coated liver slices in the pan. cook 
                until nice and brown on the bottom. Add onions, cook a bit longer,
                and you are done.
